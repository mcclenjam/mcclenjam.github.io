The rise of populism has been a topic which has attracted much attention in the past decade owing to the rise of candidates allied with this ideology across the globe. Left-populism however, and specifically forms of it which are electorally successful, is woefully understudied, which is to detriment of our broader understanding of populism. In this paper, my approach to studying this topic encompassing theories which largely center around the notion of media responsiveness. The research in this paper focuses upon the case of Sinn F ÃÅein in the 2020 Irish general election and relies upon data from Irish newspapers spanning a variety of publication types, which we analyse utilising a targeted dictionary analysis. Results show there is no relationship between either publication type or opinion-poll standing on media sentiment towards dominant left-populist parties. These findings contribute to the existing literature on left-populist media coverage, and owing to limitations in this paper there are avenues for further research on this topic..

About me
======

Currently a 1st year PhD student in the [Department of Political Science at Trinity College Dublin](https://www.tcd.ie/Political_Science/). I hold a Bachelor of Arts in Politics & International Relations, and a Master of Science in Politics and Data Science from University College Dublin. Previously I worked as an Associate Editor at [Dataminr](https://dataminr.com), mainly editing, but also focused on data analysis and programming tasks.

I plan on using this site as a platform for research/working papers by me, as well as being a portfolio for more applied projects and anything else I find interesting. If you have any questions about anything on here, please feel free to contact me!

Research interests
======
My research interests mainly concern party competition, political behavior, and elections, all investigated through the application of quantitative methods. More specifically, I am interested in the causes and consequences of issue positions and emphasis taken by parties/candidates across the political spectrum.

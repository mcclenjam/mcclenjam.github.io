## Irish Political Policy Document Database

This package was created to keep track of all those Irish party policy documents published that are not alternative budgets or manifestos, but instead the documents created by political parties which give us a more detailed insight as to their priorities. The aim of this package was to make these documents accessible to others in one place, as well as to form the basis of possible future research.
